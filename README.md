## What does this mod do?
This mod allows you to use one bonemeal to duplicate a small flower.
In vanilla, this already works for tall flowers but not small ones.

You can also use a dispenser with bonemeal to double flowers! :)

## Configuration:
You can configure the mod in two ways.
1. Edit the config file located at `.minecraft/config/flora-doubling.json`
2. Use the tag with a datapack located at `flora-doubling/tags/blocks/doubling_flora.json`

*If you use the tag, you **MUST** remove the flowers listed in the default config file.*

The default config file:
```
{
  "doublingFlora": [
    "minecraft:dandelion",
    "minecraft:poppy",
    "minecraft:blue_orchid",
    "minecraft:allium",
    "minecraft:azure_bluet",
    "minecraft:red_tulip",
    "minecraft:orange_tulip",
    "minecraft:white_tulip",
    "minecraft:pink_tulip",
    "minecraft:oxeye_daisy",
    "minecraft:cornflower",
    "minecraft:lily_of_the_valley"
  ],
  "dispenser": true
}
```

The default block tag:
```
{
    "replace": false,
    "values": [

    ]
}
```
